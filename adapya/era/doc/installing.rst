This installs the *adapya-era* with the Python package installer from
the Python Package Index web site.

A required package is adapya.base and adapya.entirex which will be also installed by pip.


Or to install from a zip file (similarly for tar file)::

.. note::
   If your local internet is protected by a http proxy you may need to set
   the HTTP\_PROXY environment variable before running pip::

       SET HTTP_PROXY=http://<httpprox.your-local.net>:<httpprox-port>

   Not setting it may result in time out operations.
